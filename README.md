Object detection is one of the most basic and central task in computer vision. Its task is to find all the interested objects in the image, and determine the category and location of the objects. Object detection is widely used and has strong practical value and research prospects. Applications include face detection and vehicle detection.

This YOLOv5 is an Open Source/Pre-defined model to detect the objects that what we want to be detect. It should be pre-trained by 80 classes in this model to detect.
